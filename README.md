## Contributing

1. Check work backlog [here](https://github.com/geraldoramos/nikola/projects)
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
3. Install the dependencies: `yarn`
4. Acquire a key from [google maps javascript api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
4. Build the code, start the app, and watch for changes: `GOOGLE_MAPS=YOURKEY yarn run dev`

To make sure that your code works in the finished app, you can generate the binary using:

```
$ yarn run build
```

Make sure to include your google maps key in the `../components/Maps.js` file before building and remember to not commit it. I will do a way to use it as `ENV` but it doesn't work for the build, just for dev environment for now.

After that, you'll see the binaries in the `packed` folder.
